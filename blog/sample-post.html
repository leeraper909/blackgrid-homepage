    <p class="mb-4">Heating grant scams target vulnerable people, especially the elderly and low-income families. These fraudsters send fake SMS and phishing emails promising grants that don’t exist.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">BlackGrid uses patented AI and geofencing technology to identify and intercept these scams before they reach victims, shutting down the criminal campaigns at the source.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Our system’s zero-install defence layer works seamlessly across telecom and digital platforms, preventing fraudulent messages and calls in real-time without user disruption.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">This protects the vulnerable, saves government funds, and keeps money circulating safely within the UK economy.</p>
